1. Why stateless web tier is preferred over statful? 
Answer:
Stateless web tier means you don't store any web data application data in web-server memory or file system. 
Keeping your web tier stateless enables you to both provide a better customer experience via better performance and 
your applications can scale well. If the web tier is stateless and it sits behind a load balancer, 
you can quickly respond to changes in application traffic by dynamically adding or removing servers. 
In the cloud environment you only pay for server resources that you consume.
